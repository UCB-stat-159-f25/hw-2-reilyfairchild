# HW 2: From Notebooks to Research Packages

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._


This project was to learn about replicating a binder environment for a groundbreaking research project, in this case the LIGO notebook that proved the existence of gravitational waves! The only changes made to the original LOSC_Event_Tutorial was a minor change from using scipy to numpy blackman, which is a window function used for digital signal processing. This notebook provides an evergreen binder instance of the study by specifying the versions of some of the critical packages the scientists utilized in their notebook.
